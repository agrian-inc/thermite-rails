# Thermite::Rails

Short description and motivation.

## Usage

How to use my plugin.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thermite-rails'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install thermite-rails
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
